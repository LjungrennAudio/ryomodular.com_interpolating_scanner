this is a very well designed and extremely  useful circuit that i have a  bunch of applications in mind for the most crucial of which being a core part of jacob's ladder. it's kinda here because all my other projects are more than becasue iplanned to share.

in fact it;s a total work of art as far as eltronic engineering goes and the otriginal purpose it was desgned for yet how universally applicable it manages to be...

maybe you too will have interesting and unusual uses for  it?
